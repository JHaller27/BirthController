# BirthController

## What is it?

Everyone has a different risk tolerance when it comes to birth control. And everyone uses different methods of birth control.
Add to that a general misunderstanding of how birth control and probability work means every night of fun can be a night of risk.

This tool does NOT aim to provide medical advice - ALWAYS consult a doctor if you have concerns.

This tool aims to provide an easy and quick way to see the level of "risk" associated with your individual birth control scenario.
